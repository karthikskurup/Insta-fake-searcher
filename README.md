### Project Description
The Kerala Instagram Profile Finder is an application designed to help users discover Instagram profiles based on location and gender preferences. Users can select a location from various districts in Kerala, such as Pathanamthitta, Idukki, Kannur, Kollam, Trivandrum, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Kochi, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, and Kasaragod, and then specify their preferred gender selection (male or female).When a user submits their choices, they are directed to a curated list of 20 profiles that match the location and gender preference. If a user selects "Male," the list will display 2 male and 18 female profiles, and vice versa if "Female" is selected. The profiles are presented with Kerala-themed names and generative profile pictures inspired by Kerala's culture. Clicking on any profile will take the user to a detailed view of the selected profile, offering further insights and interactions.This project provides a fun and localized way to explore Instagram-like profiles while highlighting Kerala's unique cultural identity.
